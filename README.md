# FoP17-18
Solutions to FoP assignments 2017-2018 @ TU Darmstadt

My solutions to the programming assignments of this year's (2017-2018) course in Functional & Object-oriented Programming at TU Darmstadt.
Solutions are complete and correct to the best of my knowledge.

I apologize for the various spelling and grammar mistakes in the assignment templates - I fixed some when I noticed them, but I'm sure quite a few remain.
